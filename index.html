								<p>I am a PhD candidate in Stanford University's Philosophy department, with interests in the history and philosophy of physics and in the history of philosophy, especially the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant and various post-Kantian figures. See <a href="#research">here</a> for more on my research and/or download my <a href="Hall_Zach_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.</p>
								<p>I have teaching experience as a teaching assistant for courses at Stanford in the history and philosophy of space-time (1x) and the history of philosophy of quantum mechanics (3x), in mathematical logic, and in a writing-intensive introductory course. I will be the primary instructor for an introductory course on the philosophy of science in the summer session of 2025 at Stanford. I also taught high school mathematics for one year prior to beginning my PhD; prior to that, I developed user-interactive tools (three java applets and one javascript page) for learning special and general relativity. See more <a href="#research">here</a>.</p>
								<p>
								<p>Here are links directly to three java applets, available for use directly in your browser:
								<ul>
								<li><a href="srlesson/SANDBOX/sandbox.html" target="_blank">The "Relativistic Sandbox"</a> </li>
								<li> A User-Interactive Visualization of Length Contraction</li>
								<li> A User-Interactive Visualization of the Relativity of Simultaneity</li>
								</ul>
								
								And here are links directly to the javascript page (a three-dimension simulation of the "frame-dragging" effect of General Relativity) and a supporting paper:

								<p>My dissertation is concerned to bring out that spin-gravity coupling is significantly undertheorized despite arguments purporting to establish that it is well-constrained <i>a priori</i>. There is no empirical data concerning this coupling, but relatively low-hanging empirical fruit to reap in characterizing the orientations of spin-measuring-devices (e.g. polarizers) when measurement events are perfectly anti-correlated. One might think that these orientations must be specified by the operation of parallel transport from General Relativity, but this is not so: there are many possible operations consistent with the theoretical and empirical support of GR; further, GR's application to <i>macroscopic</i> spinning bodies proves immaterial to the question of how <i>intrinsic</i> or point-wise defined spin should couple to gravity. The local structure of relativistic spacetimes also leaves open many more possibilities than has been appreciated, as I show by examination of the support for the "minimal coupling" procedure and of what theories procedure allows (more than has been appreciated). The general issue can be interfaced with discussions of background independence as typically discussed in making sense of the conceptual novelty of General Relativity: in light of the <i>a priori</i> constraints on what a theory of spin-gravity coupling must look like, should we expect such a theory to be background independent, and if so in what sense? (My answer to this latter question is a work in progress.)</p>
								<p> I am also interested in the work of Niels Bohr. After digging into to his response to EPR, I found I could only make charitable sense of it by looking to his pre-EPR writings, and found that, rather than advancing a hazy instrumentalism, he was concerned to work out consequences of a physical postulate uncontroversially standing at quantum theory's foundations, namely that of the reality of the Einstein-Planck-de Broglie relations; interestingly, I find him in effect to be giving a physical reason for properties of position and momentum to be "contextual," that is, for us not to be able to understand how they manifest to be independent of their physical context. You can see an article making that case <a href="https://philarchive.org/rec/HALBOE-2" target="_blank"> here</a>. I am interested in further exploring Bohr's thought with this framing and its bearing on contemporary issues in the foundations of quantum theory, such as the measurement problem and the relation of quantum mechanics to quantum field theory.</p>
								<p> Beyond the history and philosophy of physics, I am also interested in the history of philosophy, especially metaphysics and logic as theorized in the German Idealist tradition. I have a reading of Kant's Second Analogy of Experience that finds it offering resources to establish that particular laws of nature hold of their objects necessarily, because those laws and objects are co-individuating. Notably, while Kant took those laws to be deterministic, we need not while retaining the basic view; developing just how this would go is a prospective research project of mine. I also have work in progress building on this view that shows how it makes sense of "partial cognition" of particular laws of nature and "approximation" of our cognition to nomic necessity, in a way largely friendly to Necessitation Accounts of Kant on laws but that finds, as Michael Friedman urges, the necessity attaching to such laws to be conferred by the understanding. I am also interested in Kant's thought on self-consciousness or the self-reflexive character of thinking in its intuitionless purity (that of the original-synthetic unity of apperception); I take it that making sense of this aspect of Kant's thought and its role in the critical philosophy is key for understanding how it critically transforms pre-critical metaphysics and for ways post-Kantian thinkers develop the critical philosophy. I have some work in progress that (admittedly heterodoxically) reads Wittgenstein's <i>Tractatus</i> as converging with Kant's position here and makes the case that Kant's critical philosophy must at least implicitly be an exercise of thinking in its intuitionless purity thinking itself.</p>
								<p> I am interested in further reading the <i>Tractatus</i> in light of this finding (which focuses on the picture theory and the status of Tractarian nonsense therein), especially its views of logical complexity, of causality, and of ethics and freedom of the will. More ambitiously, I would like to study Hegel more seriously with a view of comparing and contrasting his philosophy, focused on pure thinking thinking itself, with those of Kant and Wittgenstein. A more local point I would like to explore is comparing and contrasting Kant's and Hegel's conception of essence, after further developing my work on Kant on particular laws so as to better understand what Kant means by "real essence."</p>

								<p>I have served as a teaching assistant at Stanford University on six occasions: once on the history and philosophy of space-time physics, three times on the history and philosophy of quantum mechanics, once for mathematical logic, and once for an introductory, writing-intensive course on philosophy of mind and metaphysics. I also taught high-school mathematics for one year prior to starting my PhD, focusing on making the learning fun with applied problems from my background in astrophysics (BA from Boston University, 2017). For more, see my <a href="Hall_Zach_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.</p> 
								
								<p> I have also developed user-interactive java applets and one javascript page to help learn special and general relativity. The applets help visualize thought experiments offered by Hermann Bondi in his "Relativity and Common Sense"; the javascript page is a three-dimensional visualization of the "frame-dragging" effect of general relativity, as represented in a near-field, low-velocity limit around a perfectly spherical body with the mass and radius of the Earth. <b><a href="srlesson/home.html" target="_blank">A more detailed description of each is available here</a></b>. There, you will also find a link to some lessons (<b>direct link <a href="srlesson/SRlesson.html" target="_blank">here</a></b>) that show how the applets can be used and how they help illustrate the lines of thinking in Bondi's book, as well as the paper deriving the equations used in the javascript page. You will also be able to download the applets on the lessons page. </p>
								
								<p>These applets are also available for use directly in your browser:
